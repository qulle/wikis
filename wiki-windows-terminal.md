# Windows Terminal Theme
A living document containing my Windows Terminal config.

## Note
This used to be a private repo but i changed it to be public because of ease of access for me. Use it as a reference if you like it but `i am not accountable for what happens when you execute commands in your environment`, use with causion and Google commands that you don't know.
